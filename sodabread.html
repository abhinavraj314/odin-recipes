    <ul>
      <li>Flour: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>Margarine: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter.
      </li>
      <li>Sugar: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread.
      </li>
      <li>Buttermilk: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher.
      </li>
      <li>Egg: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together.
      </li>
      <li>Butter: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the first six ingredients in a bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and egg.
      </li>
      <li>Turn the dough out and knead. Form the dough into a round loaf.
      </li>
      <li>Brush with butter and buttermilk, then cut an X in the top.
      </li>
      <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
      </li>
    </ol>
