    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Drain potatoes well, then return to the pot and cover with a clean dish towel. Place the pot over very low heat until potatoes are dry, 2 to 3 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the milk and green onion in a saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, 3 to 4 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Once potatoes are dry, add butter and salt; mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in warm milk mixture until well combined, then season with pepper.
